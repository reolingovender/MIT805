The Amazon Reviews Dataset 2023 Books category was selected as the working dataset for this project by considering the four previously mentioned characteristics of big data. The Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset is publicly available and was obtained from the open-source [Github repository]({https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) collected by McAuley Lab (Hou et al., 2024). It is an extensive and relevant dataset, including user reviews and item metadata from January 1996 till September 2023. The dataset comprises over 570 million reviews and 48 million items from 33 categories boasting richer and cleaner metadata structured in .json formatting. It includes finer-grained timestamps offering timestamps with up to millisecond precision over the older versions of the Amazon Reviews Dataset (Hou et al., 2024).
